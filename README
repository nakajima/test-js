= Test-JS =

For writing JavaScript tests that don't need any stinkin' browser.

== REQUIREMENTS ==

* johnson (github.com/jbarnette/johnson)
* colored (errtheblog.com/posts/34-a-ruby-rainbow)

== USAGE (still really early, probably quite buggy) ==

Running the testjs bin and pointing it at a test file:

  testjs examples/person_test.js

will yield results like this:

  .....
  Finished in 0.00228 seconds

  5 tests

If there are failures or errors, these will be reported as well.

== DOM ==

If you _must_ have the DOM, you can pass the "--dom" option. This will
include Johnson's DOM, as well as jQuery for convenience:

  testjs examples/dommy_test.js --dom

== TODO ==

* Scrap the xUnit thing and go with a more spec-y approach
* Run multiple files
