= Test-JS =

For writing JavaScript tests that run in Ruby.

Uses Johnson.

Not much to see yet. The coolest part by far is in the spec/
directory, where I've been writing tests for JavaScript in Ruby.
That's actually the exact opposite of the goal of this project,
but actually seems pretty interesting anyway.

TODO

* Add actual Ruby runner to run JS tests
* Setup/Teardown methods for tests
* Scrap the xUnit thing and go with a more spec-y approach?
