= Test-JS =

For writing JavaScript tests that don't need any stinkin' browser.

REQUIREMENTS

* johnson (github.com/jbarnette/johnson)
* colored (errtheblog.com/posts/34-a-ruby-rainbow)

USAGE (still really early, probably quite buggy)

Running the testjs bin and pointing it at a test file:

  bin/testjs examples/person_test.js

will yield results like this:

  .....
  Finished in 0.00228 seconds

  5 tests

If there are failures or errors, these will be reported as well.

TODO

* Scrap the xUnit thing and go with a more spec-y approach
* Run multiple files
